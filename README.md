Building a Meme Website with Python Flask

I built a fun meme website using Python and Flask that connects to Reddit's API to pull random memes. The site automatically loads a new meme every 30 seconds, so you get this endless stream of current memes without having to do anything. 

Flask made the whole thing pretty straightforward to build. Instead of storing memes locally, the site just grabs them directly from Reddit through their API and displays them on the webpage. It's been a great project for learning how web apps can pull data from external sources - you get to see API integration in action while having your own personal meme feed that updates automatically. 

It's satisfying to watch new memes pop up every 30 seconds, especially knowing you built the whole thing yourself!
